  Apache Toree was designed in response to our needs to enable applications
  that are both interactive and remote to work with Apache Spark. When we first
  started connecting applications to Spark, we discovered the existing
  interaction mechanisms had serious limitations, such as requiring code to be
  bundled in a JAR and writing results out to an external datastore.
