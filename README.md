### This charm is not ready for deployment yet, still WIP


# Overview

Apache Toree was designed in response to our needs to enable applications
that are both interactive and remote to work with Apache Spark. When we first
started connecting applications to Spark, we discovered the existing
interaction mechanisms had serious limitations, such as requiring code to be
bundled in a JAR and writing results out to an external datastore.

To overcome these limitations, we wrote the Apache Toree that uses the IPython
protocol. Despite the protocol’s name, the apache Toree is not limited to
supporting just Python, and indeed our first application was a Notebook for
analyzing data with Scala.

Toree supports a number of types of interactions. In one common case,
applications send snippets of code which are then executed by Spark, and the
results are returned directly to the application. This style of interaction is
what users of Notebooks experience when they evaluate code in cells. Instead of
sending raw code, an application can send magics, which might be commands to
add a JAR to the Spark execution context or a call to execute a shell command
such as “ls”. Toree provides a well-defined mechanism to associate functionality
with magics, and this is a useful point of extensibility of the system.
The Kernel also supports an RPC-like interaction for applications to communicate
with Spark. This is supported through the “Comm API” which is useful,
for example, when an application needs to repetitively apply the same function
to different data values.

Applications wanting to work with Spark can be located remotely from a Spark
cluster and use a Apache Toree Client to communicate with a Apache Toree Server
running on the cluster, or they can communicate directly with the Apache Toree
Server. Multiple clients/applications can communicate with a single Kernel which
contains a Spark application context, and this provides a simple form of
multi-tenancy.
